About

Peg, Parsing Expression Grammar, is an implementation of a Packrat parser
generator. A Packrat parser is a descent recursive parser capable of
backtracking. The generated parser searches for the correct parsing of the
input.

This Go implementation is based on:

Building

Testing

There should be no differences between the bootstrap and self compiled:

./peg -inline -switch peg.peg
diff bootstrap.go peg.peg.go

"-inline" tells the parser generator to inline parser rules. "-switch"
reduces the number of rules that have to be tried for some pegs.
